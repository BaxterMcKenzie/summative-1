                <p>NZ is the “seabird capital of the world”, but most penguin populations here are in trouble. Penguins
                    are bearing the brunt of sea warming, biodiversity loss, plastic pollution and climate change. NZPI
                    was formed to help provide project support and facilitate cooperation between volunteers and
                    community groups across the country dedicated to devoting their time to protecting penguins. As an
                    independent non-profit, our services are free and our information available to all groups who choose
                    to join. Support can include project management, monitoring resources, training, threat mitigation
                    support, equipment and data management.</p>

                    <p>Hiltrun came to New Zealand in 1991 to start a PhD on the Ecology and habitat use of introduced
                        mammalian predators of Yellow-eyed penguins, a conservation focused thesis with the aim of
                        reducing
                        predation of penguin chicks. She started working part time for Penguin Place, a private
                        conservation
                        tourism venture on the Otago Peninsula in 1994 and full time after graduating in 1997. As the
                        scientist, her job was to monitor the Yellow-eyed penguin breeding colonies, assist in the
                        rehabilitation facility, train and inform tour guides about the penguins, as well as monitor a
                        small
                        Little penguin colony.</p><br>
                    <p> She left in 2013 and started to contribute to the work of Penguin Rescue at Moeraki, North Otago
                        and
                        is still involved in the data collection and collation as well as fund raising and advocacy
                        there.
                        In 2016, she began work for Blue Penguins Pukekura, an ecotourism venture based at Taiaroa
                        Head/Pukekura initially finding and micro-chipping little penguins at Pilots Beach / Takiharuru
                        and
                        to enumerate and monitor the little penguins there. In 2021 she joined the New Zealand Penguin
                        Initiative as a penguin scientist to support and advise community groups interested in penguin
                        conservation throughout New Zealand with the aim of understanding and ameliorating threats to
                        the
