                    <p>Wellington’s Urban Kororā

                        14 Dec

                        We visited Wellington in October and were treated to some much needed sunshine! We had a great
                        exploration of the rugged Wellington's Red Rocks Coastal Walkway at Te Kopahou Reserve, where
                        kororā were once prevalent. Pest control gurus have been undertaking a huge amount of predator
                        control and regular coastal clean ups, which is surely helping the few that remain around,
                        however off-leash dogs pose a huge threat not only to kororā but the 100's of seals that visit.
                        The birds also have to navigate a busy 4WD path, so we ask people to please keep an eye out when
                        travelling around the reserve after dusk. We also had a good catch up with the awesome crew
                        from Forest & Bird - Places for Penguins and Wellington City Council to discuss development work
                        and how best to protect kororā habitat. The PfP team are doing an amazing job watching out for
                        their very urban penguins and it's great to see they have some input into the decision making!

                <div class="name__card__text">
                    <p>Our Community Programme Manager Melissa recently spent a week in Auckland visiting some wonderful
                        community groups wanting to help protect their kororā/little penguin colonies on the West Coast.
                        They are facing a multitude of threats- predators, dogs/cats, rock pigeons, human disturbance,
                        rubbish and vehicles on beaches. Thankfully great work is underway towards protecting and
                        enhancing their habitat, as well as spreading the seabird word to help them thrive. The best
                        part is....it all benefits other native species too!</p>

                <div class="name__card__text">
                    <p>Mineral Sand Mining is being proposed in Barrytown, West Coast, South Island and poses a
                        potential threat to native wildlife, including kororā/little penguins. NZPI made a submission
                        opposing the consent application and provided management recommendations to ensure the risk of
                        harm to kororā is prevented.
